# Image Classification with ResNet50 üì∑üîç

## Description
The provided imageClassifier.ipynb demonstrates image classification using the ResNet50 model from TensorFlow's Keras library. ResNet50 model is a deep convolutional neural network that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. It loads the pre-trained ResNet50 model and defines a function to preprocess an image and make predictions. The top predicted labels and their probabilities are displayed, and the classified image is visualised using Matplotlib. The file showcases the process of classifying an image and can be used as a starting point for image classification tasks.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow: A popular machine learning framework that provides tools and libraries for building and training neural networks.
- Keras: A high-level deep learning library built on top of TensorFlow, which provides an easy-to-use interface for defining and training neural networks.
- NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python, often used for handling multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical operations.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualisations in Python.
