# Image Classification with ResNet50 üì∑üîç
This imageClassifier.ipynb demonstrates image classification using the ResNet50 model from TensorFlow's Keras library. ResNet50 model is a deep convolutional neural network that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. It loads the pre-trained ResNet50 model and defines a function to preprocess an image and make predictions. The top predicted labels and their probabilities are displayed, and the classified image is visualised using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
- **tensorflow**, a machine learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- **keras**, a deep learning library built on top of TensorFlow for defining and training neural networks.
- **numpy** library for numerical computing.
- **matplotlib** library for creating visualisations.
